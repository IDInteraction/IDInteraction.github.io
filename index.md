# IDInteraction

***Capturing indicative usage models in software for implicit device interaction***

The IDInteraction project asks: can we exploit models of human behaviour to move away from direct, unambiguous user commands, towards seamless user-device interaction? It will investigate and develop the techniques to capture 'Indicative Usage Models (IUMs), behavioural patterns or cues that precede a particular activity, and translate these into software-based 'Indicative Usage Patterns' (IUPs), to drive interaction with an app. The project will focus on future television broadcasting, examining the extent to which it is possible to capture IUMs from device sensor and event data, and deploy these as IUPs to pull content (additional information or related activities) to a 'second screen companion app', which a viewer watches on a mobile device alongside a TV programme.

Our paper, ['ABC: Using Object Tracking to Automate Behavioural Coding'](https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:297728&datastreamId=FULL-TEXT.PDF) has been accepted for presentation at the 2016 CHI Conference in San Jose.
