Our blog post, ['Reproducible Research: Citing your execution environment using Docker and a DOI'](http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-03-29-reproducible-research-citing-your-execution-environment-using-docker-and-doi), has been published on the [Software Sustainability Institute website](http://www.software.ac.uk).

In it we describe how we used a combination of [Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/idinteraction/), [GitHub](https://github.com/IDInteraction) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to make the [IDInteraction tools and execution environments](/tools) both reproducible and citable with [Digital Object Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier).
